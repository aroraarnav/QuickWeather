## About

As we looked at online weather sites, something became increasingly clear. Most top weather sites have an unimaginable amount of advertisements and clutter which makes it simply impossible to get the basic weather data that is required at a glance. We have created an extremely minimal experience compared to these websites and offer users quick, relevant data retrieval with as few steps as possible. 

Our UI is designed to be intuitive, fast and minimal with zero clutter. With an API we are able to give updated climatic conditions in a city at high speeds. We are able to provide the pressure, humidty, windspeed and temperature for any city. Our software's primary feature is that it is sleek and quick.

## Details
We used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch city weather details.

The input is only meant for cities, and basic error handling has been implemented to check for other inputs. A list of countries has also been used to prevent users from inputting any countries instead of cities. 

## Instructions

Open `index.html` to run the program.

Bootstrap, FontAwesome and LinearIcons have been used. A boilerplate theme was used to generate empty html, css and js files.
